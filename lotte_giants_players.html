            <h2>Players</h2>
            <p>Lotte Giants have not been the strongest team, but it almost always had at least one star player. 
            Due to its such passionate fans, many players dream of playing in the team.
            To introduce its legend players, here is the best line-up of all time.</p>

                                Hak-gil Yun, 'crown prince' with the unprecedented 100 complete games, Jong-seok Yeom, 'scary child' who led to Lotte's championship right after high school graduation, and Hyung-gwang Joo who challenged for the most strike-outs in a single season. There were so many good pitchers in Lotte, but everyone has to be small in front of this name. It is Dong-won Choi, 'the legendary iron-arm.'
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When talking about Dong-won Choi, we cannot leave out 1984. Choi Dong-won, who has been making international fame with his powerful pitching since his amateur years, led Lotte to advance to the Korean Series for the first time, alone taking responsibility for 27 of Lotte's 50 wins in 1984, in his second year as a pro. In the Korean Series that year, Choi Dong-won displayed an unimaginable struggle to win four complete games against the Samsung Lions, which had the best one-two punches of the time, Kim Si-jin and Kim Il-sung.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dong-won Choi also had low ERAs in both 1985 and 1986 witn 20 and 19 wins, respectively, and in 1987, when he was struggling with a shoulder injury, he had a historic compelte battle with Dong-yeol Sun, 'Mudeungsan Bomber,' going up to 15th inning.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dong-won Choi, who served as commentor and coach after retirement, died of colorectal cancer, a chronic disease, on Sept. 14, 2011. To this day, however, various commemorative projects are being pursued to commemorate Choi Dong-won, both inside and outside the baseball community. This is because we can't talk about baseball in Busan and Lotte without discussing the struggles Choi Dong-won showed at Lotte.

                                Coach Kyung-moon Kim was in agony ahead of his semi-final victory in baseball at the Beijing Olympics on August 22, 2008. Jin Kab-yong, the starting catcher, suffered a hamstring injury in the preliminary match against Taiwan, making it difficult for him to play in the semifinals. Manager Kyung-moon Kim was forced to start the inexperienced 23-year-old catcher Min-ho Kang.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Kang struck out in his first three at bats in a row, but in his fourth at-bat in the bottom of the eighth inning, he fired a wedge one-run double over center fielder's height against Hideaki ofSeibu Lions. And Min-ho Kang calmly led Ryu until he was sent off in the ninth inning in the final, tying Cuba's slugger to two runs. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Min-ho Kang, who was just a promising young catcher before the Beijing Olympics, has become a national baseball star since the Olympics. And Kang Min-ho led Lotte into the postseason that year, winning the first Golden Glove of his career. "Young blood" Min-ho Kang threw a challenge to the two-way competition for the best catcher of the league between Kyung-wan Park and Kab-yong Jin.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since then, Kang has played more than 110 games every year except for 2009, when he missed 50 games due to surgery to remove bone fragments from his elbow. Kang Min-ho has won three Golden Gloves in the past five years, being the only catcher in Lotte's history to win the Golden Gloves.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After the 2017 season, he left Giants to join Samsung Lions on a 8 million dollars contract for four years. However, his performance over the past decade is enough to qualify him as the best catcher in Lotte's history.

                                Lotte has produced many good hitters, starting with Yong-hee Kim and Kim Yong-chul, Min-ho Kim,  Eung-guk Kim, Hae-young Ma, Soo-hyuk Lim, and Félix José. However, 'Big Boy' Dae-ho Lee was the first and last player to win the home run title in a Lotte uniform. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In fact, Lee Dae-ho was also a batter with many limitations in his early career. The majority of the respondents said that they would not succeed unless he loses weight.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Dae-ho, however, showed his potential as a big shot by hitting 20 home runs in his fourth year as a pro, and he stood tall as the best hitter as he achieved his second triple crown in his professional baseball career in 2006. It was the moment when the first top home run hitter in a Lotte uniform was born.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In 2007, he hits the first out of the park home run since the opening of the Sajik Stadium against Min-tae Chung of the Hyundai Unicorns. In 2010, he won seven batting titles, along with setting a new world record of home runs in nine consecutive games. Lee also became the only Lotte hitter to win the season's MVP award.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lee Dae-ho, who played for the Orix Buffaloes in Japan, continued to be overwhelming in a foreign league, winning the Japan Series MVP award. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With no opponents in Asia, he even played a year for the Seattle Mariners in Major League Baseball, the dream league for all baseball players, in 2016. The .253 batting average and 14 home runs are by no means a bad figure considering he was 35 at the time.  This also made him the first Korean to play in Korean, Japanese and American baseball league.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Returning to the home team with a record 15 billion won in 2017, he led the team to postseason in that very year. With the retirement time approaching, many baseball fans are wondering if he can get the champion's ring on his finger with Lotte.

                                The short but strong chant is what Jong-tae Park used to say to his junior players. In fact, Jong-tae Park was not just the best second baseman in the history of Korean baseball, but he was also a symbol of Lotte's never-ending grit.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Jeong-tae Park was a player with a stellar career, including the five Golden Glove awards as a second basemen and the All-Star MVP for the second consecutive year, which remains the first and only record ever to this day. In particular, Park's signature "shuffle-hitting method," which would have been copied at least once at a baseball practice range, is Park's trademark.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, it is difficult to evaluate a player named Jeng-tae Park with several awards and records. Park was the player that ran and threw hard under no circumstances.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jong-tae Park suffered a major injury in 1993 when his ankle was broken during a match. At the time, the injury was so great that one had to worry about being able to walk normally. Everyone predicted that his career would end like this, but Park didn't give up.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jong-tae Park, who returned to the ground after a year of bone-cutting rehabilitation, has made a perfect comeback with a .300 batting average since then. In particular, in the seventh round of the playoffs against Samsung in 1999, he attracted the spirit of his juniors and led the team to a big victory.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As such, Park Jung-tae is a symbol of how much one player can change the team's color and how much motivation one can give his teammates. Even now, countless young players in Busan and South Gyeongsang Province are sweating beads, dreaming of becoming "Second Jong-tae Park."

                                He has a .270 batting average and 61 career home runs. He has never hit .300 or hit more than 20 home runs, nor winning titles like home run or RBI. In addition, he has been a professional player for only eight years. If you look at the numbers, you may seem like a little player to join Lotte's legend.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But if the name is 'Mr. All-Star' Yong-hee Kim, the story changes. He entered the professional stage in 1982 at a considerable age in his late 20s.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And in that summer's All-Star game, Kim gave baseball fans an unforgettable memory. The most likely MVP candidate was his teammate Yong-chul Kim, who launched three home runs in the second game. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Yong-hee Kim, however, won the honor the first All-Star MVP in the third game when he hit the grand-slam, arguably the most exciting thing in baseball. For your information, the All-Star Game grand slam hasn't come out once in the past 30 years since Kim Yong-hee of the original year.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Two years later, Kim Yong-hee also got four out of four at the 1984 All-Star Game, monopolizing the two All-Star Game MVPs in the three years since the launch of professional baseball. This is why Yong-hee Kim, who has been on the professional stage a little after his heyday, is remembered as a homerun hitter representing Lotte for more than 30 years.

                                This is the position that I've been most concerned about. Lotte did not have a shortstop who was so outstanding to enter Lotte's all time best line-up. Still, keeping the shortstop spot empty for "no one applicable" seems to be not polite to players who have passed through Lotte's shortstop position.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lotte's first shortstop Golden Glover Kye-won Park had a very short time to call his heyday, and Min-jae Kim, who drove many female fans with a handsome face, only came to his heyday after leaving Lotte.

                                Since there is no one to be qualified since the 1990s, we will go back to the early days of professional baseball. I think of a name that I am more familiar with as a coach than as a player, Young-ki Jung.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jung Young-ki, a graduate of Shinheung Elementary School in Daejeon, Hanbat Middle School and Chungam High School in Seoul, was a founding member of MBC's Blue Dragon, and was not much associated with Lotte. To secure a spot for national team shortstop Jae-bak Kim, however, MBC traded Young-ki Jung with Lotte catcher Dong-yeol Cha. It was the first trade between players in Korean professional baseball history.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jung took the starting shortstop position instead of the decrepit Kwon Doo-jo in 1984, the second year of his transfer, helping Lotte win the Korean Series. He was also named the All-Star the following year as he recorded a .300 batting average for the first and last time in his career.
                            </p>

                                When the rookie draft in 2007, seven teams, excluding Hyundai, were able to name two players each in the area. Lotte, which had been the talk of reinforcing the mound, nominated Lee Sang-hwa and Lee Jae-gon, who were the youth players of Lotte and one-two punches at Kyungnam High School. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lotte finally called out Busan High School's outfielder Kwang-min Son's name for the fourth place, who later changed the name to Ah-seop Son. About seven years have passed since then, and Kwang-min Son, who was only famous for his looks resembling martial arts star Sung-hoon Choo, has become Lotte's new star behind Dae-ho Lee.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Although Son has different positions, he has the scent of Park Jung-tae, the "heart of Lotte baseball." Regardless of the difference in scores, he has a strong will to go around the field as much as he can, and he has a great leadership that brings out the needs of his fellow players.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Ah-seop Son is also a hard-working player who constantly finds and overcomes his weaknesses. Son Ah-seop, who made seven errors in 2011 when he changed his position from left field to right field, reduced the number of errors to less than half of them in 2012 due to a bloody defensive practice throughout the winter, and recorded the same number of steals as the year before only in 28 games in 2013.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Thanks to his efforts, he is currently one of the best outfileder in the league. With the total of 1714 hits in his career, many people believe that he will break the league's record of most hits, 2439 hits hold by Yong-taek Park. Signing a new four-year contract after 2017 season, he is expected to be the legend of the team.

                                2000 games with 2,000 hits. He had the most steals (550) and the most triples (100) in Korean baseball history. These great numbers are records set by Joon-ho Jun, the "great runner." With 19 years of professional baseball experience, Jun left Busan six years after joining the club, and played 13 years in Incheon, Suwon and Seoul.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, since Jun's presence in Busan for just six years was so great, and since he was born in South Gyeongsang Province and graduated from Masan High School in Changwon, baseball fans in Busan cannot think of him as an "another's child."
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jun, a relatively thin figure of 180 centimeters and 72 kilograms, chose to maximize his quick feet to overcome his inherently weak power. He held the bat extremely short, placing more emphasis on on-base than on long balls, and tormented the opposing defense with his bold base play. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As a result, Joon-ho Jun leaps as the first hitter of the Lotte Giants, and with a batting average of .300 and 90 runs scored in 1992, he plays a strong role as Lotte's offensive leader and makes a decisive contribution to the team's victory.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Jun also competed with Jong-beom Lee, the "son of wind" in 1993, to become the first steal king of his life. While Lee was serving in military, He won the Golden Glove of his career in 1995, getting the love of Lotte fans.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, Lotte, which had dreamed of being the best pitching team, ended up selling Jun to Hyundai Unicorns to bring in Dong-hwan Moon, the national ace, ahead of the 1997 season. Jun has won as many as four more championship rings after the tarnsfer to Hyundai, but Lotte will remain in last place as many as six times in the eight years. The exact timing of his move and Lotte's sinking. Can we really say this is a coincidence?

                                Seung-yeop Lee, Dae-ho Lee, and Shin-soo Choo. They all have one more thing in common besides being stars that make Korean baseball shine. They were pitchers when they were amateurs, but turned to fielders after joining the professional league and became successful players.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Nicknamed "swallow tail" just because his name is similar to a singer, Kim Eung-guk was also a player who entered the professional league as a pitcher and and made a big hit after turning into a fielder. Kim had been a pitcher for two years since joining the professional league in 1988, but was a dull pitcher with a career record of 0 wins, 0 losses and ERA of 5.24. In 1989, when he was so limited as a pitcher, Kim left the mound at the recommendation of his coach and began to use the outfielders' glove and bat.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Kim completely took off the tag of "ex-pitcher" by winning the MVP of the all-star game in 1991 with a .319 batting average, 79 RBIs and 29 steals, leading Lotte to its second Korean Series title in 1992.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Afterwards, Kim Eung-guk maintained his position in Lotte by showing sophisticated batting with batting average of over .300, stealing more than 20 bases. In particular, the three out of the park homeruns still remain the most in the history. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Kim has never been a title holder in his 15-year career as a batter. He didn't get past .300 batting average in seven years until retirement since 1996. This is a short example of how steady he was.

                                Although it is often seen that foreign players with fancy careers such as Dustin Nippert, a full-time big leaguer who played over 100 games, and Adam Wilk, one of the most promising players in Major League Baseball, it was not easy to see foreign players from Major League Baseball in the early days of the foreign player system.

                            <p>
                                Thus, the arrival of Felix Hose, who even played for the Major League Baseball All-Star in 1991 as a member of the St. Louis Cardinals, haㅇ been a matter of interest not only to Busan but also to other baseball fans. As rumored, his skills were also "big league-class."

                                Jose won the Golden Gloves with .327 batting average and 36 home runs in 1999, and in 2001, when he played as a designated hitter, he set a record .503 on-base percentage, for the first time in the history of Korean baseball league.

                                After hitting a home run in Game 7 of the playoffs against Samsung in 1999, Jose was excited by the water bottle thrown by the crowd and threw a bat at the stands. On September 18, 2001, against Samsung Lions, he was suspended for remaining games after stroke Yeong-su Bae's face.

                                Lotte again called Jose, who turned 40 in 2006 due to his outstanding performance, but failed to wipe out his image as a troubled child despite his age, including a scuffle against the SK Wyverns. If Jose was a more faithful player, his homerun on May 10, 2007 as 42 years old, the oldest of all time, would have been remembered as a much more valuable record.

                                In 2000, when korean baseball league managed the embarrassing two leagues with just eight teams, Lotte advanced to the semi-playoff in the capacity of the Magic League's number 2 team, even though it finished fifth among eight clubs. After the system returned back to the single league, Giants had fallen into the dark ages. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                From 2001 to 2007, Lotte had four managers, but their records were horrible. Until the LG Twins wrote a new record of 10 years, it was the longest continuous years of postseason elimination in Korea's professional baseball history.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Even when Lotte bought two FA players, when Min-han Son won MVP in 2005, and when Dae-ho Lee achieved the triple crown, its dark ages showed no signs of ending. Therefore, Lotte hired Jerry Royster, the first foreign manager in the Korean professional baseball league, ahead of the 2008 season.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But Royster was far from the image of a manager with a brilliant career. His only career in MLB was when he was fired from Milwaukee Brewers with the embarassing performance of 53 wins and 94 losses. It was only natural that he appeared to be a shabby figure to be a new captain who crossed the Pacific Ocean to save the Giants ship in crisis. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Royster, who entered the season amid doubts from everyone, solved Lotte's yearning for postseason in just one season, which the four coaches failed to pull through in seven years. In particular, the fearless baseball that Royster was pursuing instilled confidence in Lotte players, who were known for their weak endurances. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lotte, which experienced a series of postseasons over the years of 2008 and 2009, had some conflicts over resigning Royster. Lotte had been thinking about a two-year contract, as it did when it first hired Royster, but Royster wanted a multi-year contract up to five years. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the end, Lotte signed a short-term contract with Royster for just one year and gave up the contract without hesitation after Lotte was eliminated from the semi-playoff for the third consecutive year. There still are arguments over whether it was a right choice to do. However, it is as clear as the fact that Royster's no-fear spirit made Lotte's heart bounce back, which had been in a state of unconsciousness.
